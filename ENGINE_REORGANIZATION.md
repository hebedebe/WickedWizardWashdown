# Engine Reorganization Summary

## New Folder Structure

The engine has been reorganized into a cleaner, more modular structure:

### `/engine/core/`
**Core engine systems and fundamental classes**
- `actor.py` - Actor and Component base classes
- `scene.py` - Scene management system
- `asset_manager.py` - Asset loading and management

### `/engine/components/`
**Individual component files (split from the original large components.py)**
- `sprite_component.py` - Sprite rendering
- `audio_component.py` - Audio/sound management
- `health_component.py` - Health/HP management
- `text_component.py` - Text rendering
- `__init__.py` - Imports all components for easy access

### `/engine/networking/`
**All networking-related files**
- `networking.py` - Core networking system
- `network_components.py` - Network-specific components
- `network_utils.py` - Network utilities and helpers
- `__init__.py` - Networking package exports

### `/engine/rendering/`
**Rendering and visual systems**
- `enhanced_animation.py` - Animation system
- `particles.py` - Particle effects
- `ui.py` - User interface system
- `__init__.py` - Rendering package exports

### `/engine/input/`
**Input handling systems**
- `input_manager.py` - Input management system
- `input_component.py` - Input component for actors
- `__init__.py` - Input package exports

## Import Changes

### Before (Old Structure):
```python
from engine.components import SpriteComponent, HealthComponent
from engine.networking import get_network_manager
from engine.ui import UIManager
```

### After (New Structure):
```python
from engine.components import SpriteComponent, HealthComponent  # Still works!
from engine.networking.networking import get_network_manager
from engine.rendering.ui import UIManager
```

**Note:** The main engine imports still work the same way thanks to the updated `engine/__init__.py`:
```python
from engine import Game, SpriteComponent, HealthComponent  # Still works!
```

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Better Organization**: Related files are grouped together logically
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused files are easier to work with
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Import structure shows relationships between modules
4. **Modularity**: Each subsystem is self-contained
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new components or systems to appropriate folders

## Files Updated

All import statements have been updated throughout the codebase to work with the new structure:
- Engine core files
- Game scene files
- Component files
- Main application files

The reorganization maintains backward compatibility for most common use cases while providing a cleaner foundation for future development.
